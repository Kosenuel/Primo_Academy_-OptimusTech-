/*   The Buffer Module

 ///////////////Description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
 this module helps to handle binary data
////////////////___________\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Example:
To import it into your work, do;
*/

var buff = Buffer.from('abc');

// the code below converts the string "abc" into a stream of binary data;
console.log(buff);

// or, to create an empty buffer of the length '15', do;
var buff = Buffer.alloc(15);
